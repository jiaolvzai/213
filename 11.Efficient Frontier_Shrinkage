Ledoit and Wolf (2003, 2004) propose to estimate μ by X but to shrink the MLE of Σ toward structured covariance matrices that can have relatively small ”estimation error” in comparison with the MLE of Σ. Let S = Σnt=1(rt − r)(rt − r)T /n. Ledoit and Wolf’s rationale is that S has a large estimation error (or, more precisely, variances of the matrix entries) when p(p + 1)/2 is comparable with n, whereas a structured covariance matrix F) has much fewer parameters and can therefore be estimated with much smaller variances. In particular, they consider F that corresponds to the single-factor model in CAPM (see Sections 3.3 and 3.4) and point out that its disadvantage is that Σ may not equal F, resulting in a bias of F(hat) when the assumed structure (e.g., CAPM) does not hold. They therefore propose to estimate Σ by a convex combination of F(hat) and S:
  Σ = δF + (1 − δ)S, (2) where δ􏰌 is an estimator of the optimal shrinkage constant δ used to shrink the MLE toward
the estimated structured covariance matrix F(hat).

The file m ret 10stocks.txt contains the monthly returns of ten stocks from January 1994 to December 2006. The ten stocks include Apple Computer, Adobe Systems, Auto- matic Data Processing, Advanced Micro Devices, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard Com- pany, International Business Machines Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Oracle Corp. The file m_sp500ret_3mtcm.txt contains three columns. The second column gives the monthly returns of the S & P 500 index January 1994 to December 2006. The third column gives the monthly rates of the 3-month Treasury bill in the secondary market, which are obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and used as the risk-free rate here. Consider portfolios that consist of the ten stocks and allow short selling.
(a) (7.5p) Using a single-index model for the structured covariance matrix F, calculate the estimate F(hat) of F in (2)
(b) (10p) The δ(hat) in (2) in the textbook and suggested by Ledoit and Wolf (2003, 2004) is of the following form. Let fij(hat) and σ(hat)ij denote the (i, j)the entry of F and S, respectively, and define

...(see 11.fomula)


Then δ(hat) = min{1, (κ(hat)/n)+}. Compute the covariance estimate (2) with F(hat) in (a) and the δ(hat) suggested by Ledoit and Wolf, and plot the estimated efficient frontier using this covariance estimate.
(c) (7.5p) Perform PCA on the ten stocks. Using the first two principal components as factors in a two-factor model for F (see Section 3.4.3), estimate F.
(d) (10p) Using the estimated F(hat) in (c) as the shrinkage target in (2), compute the new value of δ and the new shrinkage estimate (2) of Σ. Plot the corresponding estimated efficient frontier and compare it with that in (b).
