The file m cofi 4rates.txt contains the monthly rates of the 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI), the prime rate of U.S. banks, 1-year and 5-year U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates, and U.S. Treasury 3-month secondary market rates from September 1989 to June 2007. The COFI rates are obtained from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, and the other rates are obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. COFI is a weighted-average interest rate paid by savings institutions headquartered in Arizona, California, and Nevada and is one of the most popular adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) indices. The prime rate is the interest rate at which banks lend to their most creditworthy customers.
(a) (5p) Perform the augmented Dickey-Fuller test of the unit-root hypothesis for each of these rates.
(b) (5p) Assuming the VAR(2) model for the multivariate time series of these five rates, perform Johansenâ€™s test for the number of cointegration vectors.
(c) (5p) Estimate the cointegration vectors and use them to describe the equilibrium rela- tionship between the five rates.
(d) (5p) Regress COFI on the four other rates. Discuss the economic meaning of this regression relationship and whether the regression is spurious.
