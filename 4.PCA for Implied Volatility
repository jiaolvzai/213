The file impvol sp500 atm tom.txt contains at-the-money implied volatilities (i.e., It(1,τ)) with different times to maturity (τ = T − t) of European calls on the S&P500 index for the period from January 3, 2005 to April 10, 2006.
(a) (5p) Plot the implied volatility surface versus different dates and different times to maturity. You can use wireframe in the R package lattice or surf in MATLAB to plot functions of two variables as surfaces.
(b) (5p)PerformPCAforthedifferencedseries∆t(1,τ)=logt(1,τ)−logIt−1(1,τ). Plot the first three eigenvectors versus τ.
