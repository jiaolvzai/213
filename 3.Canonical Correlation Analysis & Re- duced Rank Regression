The file m   logret   4auto.txt contains the monthly log returns of four automobile man- ufacturers (General Motors Corp., Toyota Motor Corp., Ford Motor Co., and Honda Mo- tor Co.) from January 1994 to June 2007. The file m logret 4soft.txt contains the monthly log returns of four application software companies (Adobe Systems Inc., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., and SPSS Inc.) from January 1994 to June 2007.
(a) (5p) Perform a canonical correlation analysis for these two sets of returns. Give the first two estimated canonical variate pairs and the corresponding canonical correlations.
(b) (5p) Perform reduced-rank regression of the log returns of automobile stocks on those of software company stocks, taking rank(B) = 2 in
yk=Bxk+εk, k=1,...,n.
withresponsevariableyk =(yk1,...,ykq)T ∈Rq,predictorvariablexk =(xk1,...,xkp)T ∈
Rp, and random error εk ∈ Rq such that E(εk) = 0 and Cov(εk) = Σ.
