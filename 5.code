#(d)Regress COFI on the four other rates. Discuss the economic meaning 
#of this regression relationship and whether the regression is spurious

# the regression output shows that the coefficients of X1ycmt, X5ycmt, 
#and X3mTbill.2mkt are significant.

# for both ADF test and PP test, null hypotheis of non-stationary is rejected.

# KPSS 's null hypothesis that an observable time series is stationary 
#around a deterministic trend is not rejected.

#overall, the regression seems not spurious.
#economic meaning of this regression relationship-

#The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) is a monthly weighted average 
#of the interest rates paid on checking and savings accounts offered by 
#financial institutions operating in Arizona, California and Nevada. 
#It is computed using several different factors, with interest paid on 
#savings accounts comprising the largest weighting in the average. 
#As a result, the index tends to have low volatility and follows market 
#interest rate changes somewhat slowly; it is generally regarded as a 
#two-month lagging indicator of market interest rates. It makes sense in 
#our case because we choose K=2 (time lag) in our model.
